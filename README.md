# Github User Finder

This React app leverages the Github API to help you to search Github Users.

## IMPORTANT NOTE - GITHUB API KEYS

In order to run this app you will need to grab some API keys from Github in order to query the Github User API. Add these keys to the .env.local file.

Add your client secret and client id - both of which are supplied by Github.

Once you have added your credentials, make sure to uncomment the .env.local file inside of your .gitignore!

## UPDATES

This app is a basic React app starter example. It does not use any state management such as Context API / Redux. Neither does it make use of React Hooks.

More than likely I will update this app to include state management and also make use of hooks at some point soon in the future.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Feel free to add your own tests.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />

### `npm run eject`

To change the build config. Maybe you want to use CSS modules for example.
